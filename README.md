# FCM Web Push Token Example

This repository contains a simple example demonstrating how to integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for web push notifications. The example includes two main files: `index.html`, for the web application setup, and `sw.js`, for the Service Worker responsible for handling push notifications.

## Overview

The purpose of this example is to show how you can implement FCM in a web application to send push notifications to users. It covers setting up Firebase in your web app, registering a Service Worker, and requesting a token to send notifications.

## Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have a Firebase project set up. Follow these steps to configure the project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Register your web application with Firebase.
4. Obtain your Firebase configuration object.

### Obtaining a VAPID Key

The Voluntary Application Server Identification (VAPID) key is essential for authenticating your application's server with push services. It's used when obtaining the push notification token. Here's how to generate and find your VAPID key:

1. Navigate to the Cloud Messaging tab in your Firebase project settings.
2. Under the `Web configuration` section, you will find your `Web Push certificates`.
3. Here, you can generate a new pair of keys if you haven't already. Once generated, your public key is your VAPID key.

Include your VAPID key in the `index.html` file as follows:

```html
getToken(messaging, { serviceWorkerRegistration: registration, vapidKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_KEY' })
### Configuration
```
Replace the placeholder values in the `firebaseConfig` object in `index.html` with your actual Firebase project configuration values. Also, replace `'YOUR_VAPID_KEY'` in `index.html` with your VAPID key.

```html
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
```

### Service Worker

Ensure the `sw.js` file is located in the root directory of your project so it can be correctly registered by the web application.

## Usage

To use this example, simply serve the `index.html` file through a local or remote web server. If you're testing this locally, you can use simple server solutions like Python's HTTP server module or npm's http-server package.

When the `index.html` page is loaded in a browser, it attempts to register the Service Worker and request a push notification token. Successful retrieval and display of the token in the console indicate that the setup is correct.
